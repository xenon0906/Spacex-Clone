- `css/styles.css`: The primary stylesheet for styling the web page.
- `css/reset.css`: A CSS reset file to ensure consistency across different browsers.
- `js/main.js`: The main JavaScript file for adding interactivity.
- `images/`: A directory containing all the images used in the project.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: A responsive navigation bar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing hero section with a background image and a call-to-action button.
- **Missions Section**: A section that displays SpaceX missions with images and brief descriptions.
- **Footer**: A footer section with social media links and contact information.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spacex-clone.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd spacex-clone
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser**:
    You can do this by double-clicking the `index.html` file or by running a local server (e.g., using VS Code Live Server or Python's SimpleHTTPServer).

## Usage

Once you have opened `index.html` in your browser, you can navigate through the different sections of the site. The navigation bar allows you to jump to different sections, and the site should adjust its layout according to your screen size.
